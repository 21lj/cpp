# EA Sports Software Engineering Virtual Experience Program

This repository documents my completion of the **Software Engineering Virtual Experience Program** offered by **Electronic Arts (EA)** through [Forage](https://www.theforage.com/simulations/electronic-arts/software-engineering-awbf).

---

## 🚀 Overview

As part of this simulation, I worked on the **EA Sports College Football** codebase, engaging in real-world inspired tasks that reflect the day-to-day work of a software engineer at EA. 

The experience allowed me to demonstrate my skills in:

- Feature design  
- Object-oriented programming (OOP) in C++  
- Code optimization

## ✅ Tasks Completed

### 1. 📄 Feature Proposal
- Proposed a new gameplay feature for *EA Sports College Football*.
- Wrote a detailed **Feature Proposal** outlining the purpose, scope, and stakeholder impact.
- Ensured alignment with EA’s design principles and user engagement strategies.

### 2. 🧩 Class Design and Header File Implementation
- Created a **UML class diagram** to model the objects involved in the new feature.
- Implemented class definitions in a C++ header file.
- Demonstrated OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and modularity.

### 3. 🛠️ Bug Fix and Code Optimization
- Identified and patched a bug in the existing codebase.
- Improved performance by refactoring code and implementing a more efficient data structure.
- Ensured code readability and maintainability according to EA’s engineering standards.
